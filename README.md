# prod-ready-social-media-v2

An enterprise-realistic social media platform built with Java/Spring, React, and Playwright.

## Monorepo layout

This repo is a flat monorepo. Each top-level directory is owned by one component:

| Directory   | Status      | Component                                         |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `backend/`  | exists      | Java 21 / Spring Boot 4 service (Gradle, Postgres) |
| `frontend/` | exists      | React web client (Vite, TypeScript, pnpm)         |
| `e2e/`      | exists      | Playwright end-to-end harness (Testcontainers Postgres + JAR backend + vite preview) |
| `infra/`    | reserved    | Infrastructure-as-code (added by a future scaffold change) |
| `openspec/` | exists      | OpenSpec change/spec workflow                     |

Reserved directories are not pre-created — each is added by its own scaffold change so the repo
never contains empty placeholder folders.

## Local development

A single `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root brings up the dependencies (currently Postgres)
that any component needs locally. The backend, future frontend dev tooling, and future e2e all
point at this same file.

```sh
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

See `backend/README.md` for backend-specific run and test instructions,
`frontend/README.md` for the frontend dev loop, and `e2e/README.md` for the
Playwright end-to-end harness.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Node (version pinned in `frontend/.nvmrc`) and pnpm (for the frontend)
- Docker (for Postgres and Testcontainers)
